# Evaluation of collaboration
We both have previous experience in software development so we both have had a clear vision on how we wanted to design 
the application. We had a very high focus on re-usability and modularisation, therefore the code we have written is 
split into 4 main parts; cli, common, orm, and server.

In the beginning we tried to follow a strict-ish workflow, where we created issues and feature-branches. However after a
while it became a bit more meta-work to register everything on github, and since the workload was fairly manageable and
we meet almost everyday we handled managing the project face-to-face. At the end we ended up more or less just working 
directly on the master branch.

Because of our previous experience it was fairly easy to discuss solutions and design decisions. However since we both 
was not used to TDD it was a bit hard make sure we wrote tests for everything.

## Evaluation of others
Because of our knowledge level compared to most of the other students we have spent a considerable amount of time 
helping others both with debugging errors and discussing design decisions.

# Grade
We believe that our project qualify for an A.
